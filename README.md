This is a really simple bot that I made, also this calculator is not really that advance so lol.
This can do basic addition (+), subtraction (-), division(/) and multiplication(*).
It can handle things like 16+2-4*5/6, however, it cannot handle things like: 1^2, 4^2. So yeah!

Why did I make this? I got bored, OK?
Don't ask :)

Have fun!
